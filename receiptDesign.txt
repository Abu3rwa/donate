Design a printable/exportable document (receipt, campaign report, donation bill, or financial statement) for a non-profit/charity management system. The design must be:
Modern, clean, and professional
RTL (right-to-left) layout for Arabic
Consistent with the following style and structure:
1. Overall Layout
Use a solid white background for the main content area (background-color: #fff).
Center the content in a container with a max width of 800px, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow.
Use clear sectioning with padding and spacing between sections.
All text should be readable, with clear hierarchy (headers, subheaders, body).
2. Header
Top section includes:
Organization logo (rounded, left or right, 50–80px wide, bordered)
Organization name (large, bold, colored, e.g., #198754)
Optional long name or description (smaller, muted)
A horizontal divider (solid or colored) separates the header from the body.
3. Document Title & Meta
Prominently display the document type (e.g., "إيصال تبرع", "تقرير الحملات", "فاتورة", "كشف حساب").
Show meta info (e.g., receipt number, date, export date) in a clear, compact area.
4. Main Data Table/Section
Use a table or well-aligned grid for the main data (donation details, campaign stats, bill items, etc.).
Table headers have a solid background (e.g., #f8f8f8 or brand color), bold text, and clear separation.
Table cells are padded, with alternating row backgrounds for readability.
Use badges for statuses (e.g., completed, pending, suspicious, error) with distinct background colors.
5. Sections for Extra Info
Use section boxes with a light background (#fdfdfd or similar), border, and rounded corners for:
Campaign details (name, goal, raised, dates, description)
Admin/issuer info (name, email, phone)
Organization info (description, location, contacts, website, social links)
Notes or comments
Each section has a bold, colored title and clear separation from others.
6. QR Code & Verification
Include a QR code (centered, bordered, with a caption) for receipt or document verification.
The QR code should encode a verification URL or unique document link.
7. Footer
Footer is separated by a solid or colored border.
Includes a thank you message, organization name, and contact info.
Website and social links are styled and clickable.
8. Branding & Accessibility
Use the organization’s brand color (e.g., #198754 for green) for accents, headers, and buttons.
All text must be readable with sufficient contrast.
Use accessible font sizes and semantic HTML.
All links are underlined on hover.
All images have alt text.
9. Solid Backgrounds
The main content area and all section boxes must have a solid background (no gradients or transparency).
Use white (#fff) for the main background, and very light gray (#f8f8f8, #fdfdfd) for section backgrounds.
Status badges use solid, high-contrast backgrounds (e.g., green for success, yellow for warning, red for error).
10. Flexibility for Document Types
The template should be easily adaptable for:
Donation receipts
Campaign reports
Bills/invoices
Financial statements
Any other summary or detailed report
Only show sections relevant to the document type (e.g., campaign info for campaign reports, bill items for invoices).
Data Fields to Include (as relevant):
Organization: name, longName, logo, description, location, website, contacts (phones, emails), social links
Document meta: type, number, date, export date
Donor: name, phone, email, isAnonymous
Donation: amount, currency, campaign, payment method, status, notes, recurring info
Campaign: name, goal, raised, status, start/end dates, description
Admin/issuer: name, email, phone, role
QR code: verification URL
Footer: thank you message, org name, contacts, website, social
