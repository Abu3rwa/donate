# Org Files Feature

## Overview

The **Org Files** feature is a standalone document management module for the organization. It allows the organization to manage, store, and share important documents and files in a centralized location, independent of the user management system. This can include bylaws, policies, meeting minutes, financial reports, and any other files relevant to the organization's operations.

> **Note:** The Org Files feature should be accessible from the main navigation or via a dedicated button in the Quick Actions menu, making it easy for all organization members and admins to find and use.
