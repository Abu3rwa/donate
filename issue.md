# React Router 'type is invalid' Error in App.js

## Error Message

```
Warning: React.jsx: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check your code at App.js:144. Error Component Stack
    at AppContent (App.js:98:1)
    at Router (components.tsx:421:1)
    ...
```

## Analysis

- This error means that a component passed to a `<Route element={...} />` or rendered in JSX is not a valid React component, but an object (usually `{}`).
- This is almost always caused by:
  1. Importing a component as a default import when it is only exported as a named export (or vice versa).
  2. The file being missing, so the import resolves to `{}`.
  3. The import path being wrong (e.g., pointing to a folder without an `index.js`).
  4. A typo in the file or folder name.
  5. A circular import or export issue.

## Prompts to Fix

1. **Check All Imports in App.js**

   - Make sure every import path matches the actual file location and casing.
   - Example: `import AboutPage from "./pages/about/AboutPage";` (not `./pages/about` unless there is an `index.js`)

2. **Check for Missing Files**

   - Ensure every file you import exists at the specified path.
   - If you deleted or renamed a file, update or remove the import.

3. **Check Export Types**

   - If you use `import X from ...`, the file must have `export default X;`.
   - If you use `import { X } from ...`, the file must have `export { X };`.

4. **Check for Typos**

   - File and folder names are case-sensitive on most systems.
   - Example: `CampaignsPage.js` vs `campaignspage.js`.

5. **Check for Circular Imports**

   - If two files import each other, one may resolve to `{}` at runtime.

6. **Check for Index.js in Folders**

   - If you import from a folder, ensure it has an `index.js` that re-exports the component.

7. **Check for Correct Exports in All Page Components**
   - All main page components (HomePage, AboutPage, CampaignsPage, etc.) should have `export default ...` at the end.

## Example Fix

If you see:

```js
import AboutPage from "./pages/about";
```

But there is no `./pages/about/index.js`, change it to:

```js
import AboutPage from "./pages/about/AboutPage";
```

## Next Steps

- After fixing imports/exports, restart your dev server.
- If the error persists, check the browser console for the exact import that is failing.
- If you need to, comment out routes one by one to isolate which import is causing the error.
