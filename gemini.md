# Error Log: getDonationsForCampaign Not Found

**Error:**

```
export 'getDonationsForCampaign' (imported as 'getDonationsForCampaign') was not found in '../../services/donationsService'
```

**Cause:**

- The code is trying to import a function named `getDonationsForCampaign` from `src/services/donationsService.js`, but this function does not exist or is not exported from that file.

**Solution:**

- Implement a function called `getDonationsForCampaign` in `donationsService.js` that fetches all donations for a given campaign (by campaignId), and export it.
- Alternatively, use an existing function (such as `fetchDonations`) and filter the results by campaign in your component.

**Action Steps:**

1. Check if `getDonationsForCampaign` exists in `donationsService.js`.
2. If not, add and export it.
3. Update imports and usage in your components as needed.
