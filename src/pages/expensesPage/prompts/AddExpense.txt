# Add Expense - Requirements and Considerations

When creating an expense, the following should be considered:

1. **Campaign Association**: Each expense must be linked to a specific campaign. The user should be able to select the campaign when adding an expense.
2. **Expense Details**: The user provides a name/description for the expense, amount, and other relevant details.
3. **Campaign Donations Awareness**: When selecting a campaign, the user should be able to see the total amount of donations collected for that campaign. This helps ensure that expenses do not exceed available funds.
4. **Validation**: The system validates that the expense amount does not exceed the total donations for the selected campaign, checks campaign status and budget limits, validates currency format, and ensures reasonable amounts. The form includes user-friendly error messages and field validation for required fields and correct data types.
5. **UI/UX**: The add expense form features a modern, clean, and accessible UI. Required fields are clearly marked, errors are shown inline, and the form is responsive and easy to use.
6. **Data Model**: Expenses store a reference to the campaign they are associated with (e.g., campaignId), as well as all other relevant details.
7. **Audit Trail**: The system logs who created the expense, tracks changes to expense status, and maintains a complete history of all modifications.
8. **Receipt Generation**: The system automatically generates expense receipts with unique receipt numbers and sends notifications to relevant parties.
