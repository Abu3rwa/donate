AI Prompt for StatusBadge.js

Create a highly reusable and accessible React component called StatusBadge for an expense management system. The component should:

- Accept a `status` prop (string: 'approved', 'pending', 'rejected', or others).
- Display a visually distinct, rounded pill badge with color coding:
  - Green for approved
  - Yellow for pending
  - Red for rejected
- Show the status label in Arabic (use a mapping from constants.js), and support internationalization for future expansion.
- Ensure excellent color contrast for readability (WCAG AA compliant).
- Be visually clear, bold, and small, with appropriate padding and margin.
- Support both RTL and LTR layouts seamlessly.
- Handle unknown statuses gracefully (show the status as-is, with a neutral color).
- Use PropTypes for type safety and document all props.
- Be fully responsive and accessible:
  - Use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., role="status" or aria-label)
  - Keyboard navigable if interactive (otherwise, ensure it is not focusable)
  - Optionally, add a subtle fade-in animation for status changes
- Import status label/color mapping from constants.js.
- Export as a functional component.
- Follow best practices for maintainability and scalability.
