AI Prompt for ExpenseBills.js

Create a robust and accessible React component called ExpenseBills for an expense management system. The component should:

- Accept an `expenseId` prop (string or number).
- Fetch bills for the given expenseId using getBillsForExpense from billsService.
- Display a list of visually distinct, clickable links for each bill ("مرفق 1", "مرفق 2", ...), opening in a new tab.
- If no bills exist, show a clear, accessible message: "لا توجد فواتير".
- Show a loading spinner or skeleton while fetching bills.
- Gracefully handle and display errors (e.g., "تعذر تحميل الفواتير").
- Be responsive and fit both card and table layouts.
- Use PropTypes for type safety and document all props.
- Be accessible and RTL/LTR compatible:
  - Use semantic HTML for lists/links
  - Add aria-labels for links
  - Ensure keyboard navigation
- Support internationalization for all messages.
- Export as a functional component.
- Follow best practices for maintainability and scalability.
