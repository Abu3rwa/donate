# HomePage.js Improvement Suggestions

## 1. UI/UX Enhancements

- **Responsive Design:** Ensure all elements (especially the HeroSection and stats grid) are fully responsive on all device sizes. Test on mobile and tablet.
- **Hero Image Optimization:** Use `srcSet` or next-gen formats (WebP/AVIF) for the hero image to improve loading speed.
- **Call to Action:** Consider adding a secondary CTA (e.g., "Learn More" or "Volunteer") for users not ready to donate.
- **Impact Section:** Make stats dynamic by fetching real data from Firestore instead of hardcoding values.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Add `alt` text for images (even background images for screen readers).
  - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards.
  - Use semantic HTML where possible (e.g., `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`).
- **Animations:** Use more subtle or context-aware animations for the scroll-down icon and stats.

## 2. Code Structure & Maintainability

- **Component Extraction:**
  - Move `AnimatedNumber`, `ImpactStatisticsSection`, and `FacebookLink` to their own files in `src/components/` for reusability and clarity.
  - Consider a `StatsCard` component for each stat.
- **Props & Types:**
  - Use PropTypes or TypeScript for type safety, especially for components like `EmergencyAlertBanner`.
- **Theming:**
  - Use MUI's theme more consistently for colors and spacing instead of hardcoded Tailwind classes.
- **State Management:**
  - If the emergency alert is global, consider moving its state to a context or global store.

## 3. Performance

- **Image Optimization:**
  - Lazy-load images where possible.
  - Compress hero and icon SVGs.
- **Memoization:**
  - Use `React.memo` for stateless components that receive props.
- **Reduce Re-renders:**
  - Ensure `AnimatedNumber` only re-renders when value changes.

## 4. Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links) are keyboard accessible.
  - Add `aria` labels where needed.
- **Screen Reader Support:**
  - Use visually hidden text for icons and important actions.

## 5. Content & Localization

- **Dynamic Content:**
  - Fetch emergency alerts and stats from Firestore or a CMS for real-time updates.
- **Localization:**
  - Use a translation library (e.g., `react-i18next`) for multi-language support.

## 6. Testing

- **Unit & Integration Tests:**
  - Add tests for all components, especially for alert logic and stat animation.
- **Accessibility Testing:**
  - Use tools like axe or Lighthouse to audit accessibility.

**Next Steps:**

1. Refactor components into separate files.
2. Replace hardcoded data with Firestore queries.
3. Audit accessibility and responsiveness.
4. Optimize images and performance.
5. Add tests and consider localization support.
